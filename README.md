# Balloon-Shooter
Simple FPS. Shoot the boxes to release the balloons. Shoot the balloons to get the high score.

This was my second fully functional (but not really complete) project. It is a very simple first person shooter in which you pop balloons to increase your score. It all looks very basic, but behind the scenes it certainly took some effort on my part to get it all working. I spent about 28 hours working on this project.

There are some missing bits (a settings button, but no settings) and some bugs still left (achieving the top score places it in both the first and second spots), but it was a little more complex than the endless runner that came before it and I felt I was making decent progress.
